## Tracks

### Skillsmaxxing

Build skills that make OpenClaw agents smarter and more capable. This is the optimization track — security guardrails, metaprompting, smart model routing, token efficiency, cost optimization, domain-specific intelligence. If it levels up what an agent can do, it belongs here.

**Ideas to get you started:**

- Security guardrail skills that prevent agents from doing dangerous things
- Metaprompting systems that optimize how agents structure their own prompts
- Smart model router that picks the cheapest model capable of handling each task
- Context compression that summarizes conversation history to save tokens without losing quality
- Tool chain optimizer that pre-plans multi-step sequences instead of figuring it out turn-by-turn
- Retry/fallback skill that catches failures and intelligently retries with different providers
- Domain-specific skills (legal, real estate, finance) with measurable before/after improvement

### Best Deployment Tool

Make it dead simple to set up and deploy an OpenClaw bot. The easier the better. If your grandma could deploy it, you're on the right track. One-click setups, simplified configuration, deployment scripts, hosting solutions — anything that lowers the barrier to getting an agent running.

**Ideas to get you started:**

- One-command deploy script that handles everything from install to channel pairing
- Docker Compose setup with pre-configured defaults
- Web-based setup wizard that generates your openclaw.json
- Deploy-to-Railway / Deploy-to-Fly.io one-click templates
- Mobile-first setup flow where you configure everything from your phone




### Automate Your Life

Build an agent that replaces something you actually do manually. Work, personal, business — if it saves real time, it counts. Browser automation, cron jobs, messaging integrations, webhooks, whatever gets the job done.

**Ideas to get you started:**

- Invoice processing agent: watches Gmail, extracts line items, logs to spreadsheet, sends summary to your phone
- Lead qualification bot: monitors form submissions, researches companies via browser, routes hot leads to Slack
- Social media repurposing: send it a blog post via WhatsApp, get platform-specific posts back
- Meeting prep agent: cron job checks calendar each morning, researches attendees, texts you a briefing
- Inventory/restock alerts for a small business via browser monitoring
- Bill payment autopilot: watches email for due dates, logs into portals, confirms payments
- Job search agent: monitors listings, matches against your criteria, sends matches to Telegram



### SalesMolty Track w/ Linkt AI

**Sponsored by Linkt AI**

It's the age of the GTM Engineer. Turn the *art* of sales into a **science**. GTM Engineer is the fastest growing role in the world — basically: how can I use AI to increase my book of business? Linkt enables the GTM builders, OpenClaw just pour.

This track is about combining Linkt's data intelligence with OpenClaw's automation to build AI-powered sales and go-to-market workflows.

**How it works:** Linkt handles the lead intelligence and data layer (finding companies, tracking hiring signals, monitoring funding rounds). OpenClaw handles the execution layer (building assets, sending outreach, automating follow-ups). Together they create end-to-end GTM machines.

**Example use cases:**

- **Linkt:** "Find startups in Starbase, TX that have raised capital in the last 18 months."
**Molty:** "Make a custom landing page for each lead, and send direct targeted outbound and LinkedIn connections to founders."
- **Linkt:** "Alert me when an Austin-based startup is hiring for their first marketing role."
**Molty:** "Look through company case study repositories, create demo web app showing how my human's solution can help improve marketing efficiency."
