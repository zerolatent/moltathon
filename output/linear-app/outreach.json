The Ramp case study (50 to 500 engineers on Linear) is exactly the kind of enterprise motion that's hard to scale without losing the product-led magic.\n\nWe help DevTools companies like Vercel and Supabase build sales processes that technical buyers actually respect. No sleazy tactics—just systems that convert engineering leaders.\n\nPut together a quick page with some thoughts specific to Linear:\nhttps://signal-to-site.netlify.app/linear-app\n\n15 minutes to compare notes?\n\nBest,\nSarah\nHead of Growth, SalesBot AI",
